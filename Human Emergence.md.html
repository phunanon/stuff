<p><i>Example of gravitational lens, which while is very pronounced here occurs in microscopic amounts everywhere all the time, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational%5Fmicrolensing">gravitational microlensing</a>.</i></p>
<p><i>Synopsis.</i> The universe began (therefore is not infinite) as a very hot, small, and dense superforce (the mix of the four fundamental forces), with no stars, atoms, form, or structure (called a "singularity"). Then about 13.8 billion years ago space expanded very quickly (thus the name "Big Bang"). This started the formation of atoms which eventually led to the formation of stars and galaxies. Throughout this time, though early conditions were the most violent in the history of the universe, every event followed physical, deterministic laws which persist until today.</p>
<p><i>Evidence.</i> The theory of general relativity laid down by Einstein has given the ability to interpret observations with accurate and robust mathematical tools. Using these tools we can extrapolate that the universe was once very uniformly distributed and small. The still-ongoing expansion of the universe is supported by observing "red-shift" in the light from distant areas. Over great lengths of time and space light will shift toward the red end of the spectrum due to the Doppler effect, which would only happen if the universe was expanding.</p>

<p>This means, for example, galaxies that are twice as far from us move twice as fast away from us. But we are not the centre, rather <i>everything</i> is moving away from <i>everything else</i>. Interestingly due to this, there is a radius around any point in the universe which beyond is unobservable and unreachable. A journey to the edge of this radius would never end as it expands further away than the speed of light, even though the contents in between are moving only a fraction of that speed.</p>
<p><i>Opposition.</i> The theory has its opponents, with some saying we do not know what happened before a certain point of time advocates would describe as fractions of a second before the beginning. However even these opponents typically uphold the theory until very earliest part of known history, such as <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-11-cosmologist-lonely-big-theory.html">Jim Peebles</a>.</p>
<p><i>Naturalism.</i> At least within the confines of our observable universe all events have occurred according to an unbroken set of deterministic physical laws. Even the randomness understood through quantum mechanics follows an equation of probability. The only supernatural occurrences that could have possibly happened would have been in the construction of the <i>initial</i> state of the universe.</p>
